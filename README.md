# 8/2/2023

Added `GameAssembly.dll` patcher, you just have to put the original `GameAssembly.dll` in the same folder as `patch_ga.py` then it will generate `GameAssembly_patched.dll` and put it in Muse Dash directory.
Currently doesn't have Wildcard Bytes support (cuz im skill issue ðŸ˜­)

# 8/3/2023

Added support for Wildcard Bytes, so no need to hardcode the whole actual bytes.
The `consts.py`, `main.py`, and `utility.py` is not needed if you use the `patch_ga.py` as i am no longer updating the offset for runtime patching.

# How to use?

1. Put original `GameAssembly.dll` to the same directory as `patch_ga.py` (Take the original `GameAssembly.dll` from Muse Dash directory)
2. Then run `patch_ga.py` (`python patch_ga.py`)
3. Wait for a while until it generated `GameAssembly_patched.dll`
4. Put `GameAssembly_patched.dll` to your Muse Dash directory and rename it to `GameAssembly.dll`
